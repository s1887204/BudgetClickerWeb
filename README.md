# BudgetClickerWeb

Cookie Clicker, but it was made on a $1 budget.
(This game is a joke, it was made as a gag for friends, not a project, just to show what I'm capable to do)

This was made in GODOT Engine 4.0.

## the story
uh oh, you have accidentally went into crippling debt after losing a lawsuit to the BUDGETCRAFT creators!11!! you are now forced to sell cookies against your will to pay back the crippling debt!11! make 1 trillion cookies so you can pay back your debt towards them for trying to make a budget knockoff!11!!

## game explanation for now
uhh nothing much. side buttons don't work yet. if you wish to save to your browser cookies (funny haha) you can press "C" and hope that it saves properly, as it could malfunction somehow.
will make downloading your saves and importing them possible when I can and when I'm smart enough.
screen is also kinda messed up, looking into a fix when I can.
